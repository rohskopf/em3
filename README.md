# em3
Easy Modular Molecular Mechanics (EM3) Program

These instructions only pertain to a Linux environment with GNU Make, GCC, and OpenMPI installed.

Compile EM3 in the /src directory by simply typing "make". This will create an executable 
called "em3".

Example INPUT and CONFIG files for each of the cases discussed in the manual given in the 
/examples directory. To run these examples, simply execute the "em3" executable in the same
directory as the INPUT and CONFIG files.

This can be done by simply typing "./em3" in those directories, with the em3 exectubale in 
the directory.
